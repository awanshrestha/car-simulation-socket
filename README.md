# car-simulation-socket
A remote controlled 2D car driving simulation using socket.IO. This simulation of a remote controlled car was built while learning socket.IO for making a real [remote controlled rover](https://techyexplorer.com/rover-control-from-cell-phone/). It consists of only basic controls. For more advanced controls, something like [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) could be used.
